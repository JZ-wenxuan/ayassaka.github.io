Hi, my friend.

Thanks for coming here.

This is the site for some game-dev related project called *Project Magic*.

Project Magic is a project for an independent research course in University of Michigan. The theme is yet undecided, though.
I'm currently thinking about some options:
- making a game with mechanics about time travel, portals, and non-euclidean space
- or an educational game on linguistic stuff, like IPA symbols
- or something related to Live2D?

Whatever. It's the first week so, well, let's see if there is anything else coming into mind.😉
